Whenever I try to train KNN model with all features given in a dataset with maximum 7 counts of neighbours,the main problem faced by this method was slower computation due to which fail to acieve the the accuracy of a given dataset ...first i trained with max 7 numbers of neighbour with excluded f_27 column which was irrelevent column,then with minimizing number of neighbours by 3 and then 1 , the accuracy achieved by using count of 3 neighbours,through this method, approx 50% by a given dataset with in maximum 1 hours and 13 min of computation...
