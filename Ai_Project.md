Multiple Sykit model Tried and Tested with removing one of the feature of a given dataset column f_27, the problem we face how to convert the string data into a float value which is actual the column f_27.
After tested approximately 7 to 8 models in which most of models given accuracy in between 55% to 70% of accuracy. Finally our team have to achieved nearby 72% accuracy with a given dataset by DecisionTreeClassifier Model.
