Multiple Sykit model Tried and Tested with removing one of the feature of a given dataset column f_27, the problem we face how to convert the string data into a float value which is actual the column f_27. 
In this Model Underfitting problem appears when the developed model is too simple, leading both the train errors and test errors are large. In contrast, overfitting problem happens when the model is too complicated but itâ€™s not supposed to be, this making the train errors be small and test errors be large.  After tested approximately 7 to 8 models in which most of models given accuracy in between 55% to 70% of accuracy. Finally our team have to achieved nearby 72% accuracy with a given dataset by DecisionTreeClassifier Model.

We work on extra tree classifier and ridge classifier module.
Extra tree classifier is an ensemble algorithm which ue number of decision tree at the back end and each decision 
tree is uncorrelated to each other.Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. 
This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs,
 least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values.We reached at the accuracy of 71%

Sir my model is SVM ("Support Vector Machine ") I have tried to train this model  to get accuracy by running the code for almost 6+ hours but I didn't get any accuracy so
I reduced the THRESHOLD..  
removed the DATA STRING column..
converted NEGATIVE columns into POSITIVE columns..
Reduced FRATURES of DATA..
Splited TRAINED DATA..
But still was unable to get the accuracy..
Below is the Best accuracy of our group work
